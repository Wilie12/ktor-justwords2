# JustWords2API
JustWords2API is a REST API, written in Kotlin with Ktor, it's serving learning words for my Android app [Get it here](https://github.com/Wilie12/JustWords2). API supports user authentication and its resources are restricted under JWT authorization.
## Resources
There are 4 main resources in JustWords2API:
- Auth
- Words/Books/WordSets
- UserInfo
- UserHistory

Note: In order to use API, you have to fetch previously created words database.
## How to prepare database
API is designed to work with previously created database, it doesn't support creating new Words/Books/Wordsets.
### Create a Book
Book holds multiple WordSets.
```json
{
  "name": "First Book",
  "color": -14928072
}
```
Note: API uses MongoDB, which autogenerates ObjectId.
### Create a WordSet
Wordset holds multiple Words divided into groups.
```json
"name": "Personality",
"bookId": "6707f56059f9f0f47acb70e3",
"numberOfGroups": 1
```
Note: BookId has to be previously generated ObjectId for Book.
### Create a Word
Words are divided into groups, there can be multiple groups in one WordSet
```json
"sentence": "She is an ambitious career woman.",
"wordPl": "ambitny",
"wordEng": "ambitious",
"setId": "6707f58059f9f0f47acb70e6",
"groupNumber": 1
```
Note: SetId has to be previously generated ObjectId for WordSet.
### Explaination
JustWords2API was originally designed in Polish but can be used to learn any language.
- wordPl stands for word in your current language
- wordEng stands for word in lanugage you desire to learn
- senstence is written in language you desire to learn

### Summary
After inserting these Jsons into MongoDB JustWords2API can be used with my application [Get it here](https://github.com/Wilie12/JustWords2).
